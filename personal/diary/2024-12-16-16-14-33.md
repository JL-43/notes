# Do I stay

I have only been here in Europe for 6 months.

I am wondering if I should stay.

Very much, my home calls to me.

Could it be just a case of the grass being greener on the other side?

Or was the comfort that was there, something true?

On paper, here is where I should be

The weather, the people, the quality of life

But it seems, it is not where my heart is

I miss my family, of course

I miss seeing people, but I recall just as well when I disliked being around them

Maybe, I just need to take the time to grow here, and 6 months might be way too short

Is it not, as I told myself, a bridged I have burnt already?
