Today I want to Blend Cafe. Had some apple and cinnammon waffles. I just took my time and tried to study there.

I am feeling quite anxious about quite a few things. I am particularly worried about being able to produce good art. I want to draw, I want to make music, I want to display something and tell the world something. Not for the sake of recognition, but for the sake of "I want to say something" and I want people to think about it. I don't want to be recognized. I want to *contribute*. I want people to think about something. And, I want them to have those thoughts by looking or hearing something that I have created.

I have been trying to learn music--I bought myself a MIDI keyboard. I have been trying to learn how to draw--I bought myself a sketch book. I have been trying to write--I am typing this right now, as we speak, to get better at writing. I have been trying to make videos--I recorded myself talking about a random topic

Why am I chasing after this so badly? 

I do no know. But I want to create something. I feel as if there is so much love and care inside of me that I cannot put out

I want to pour that passion into something

I want to feel the thrill of my heart racing and having my hands and fingers turn my soul into something beautiful
