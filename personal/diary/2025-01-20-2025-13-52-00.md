I had a pretty rough go at it for the past couple of days

I did not really want to talk to anyone

And I was having a hard time with

"How come the people that hurt me are happy?"

Or at least seemingly so.

And

"How can they do that to a person they claim to love?"

It's a lot of thoughts 

But then yesterday I decided to play Zenless Zone Zero

I wanted to sit down, and really play it

I keep terming it as I "forced" myself to do it

And, while, a little bit of that is true

I think the more appropriate term is 

"Consciously played"

Because I had always found it fun

But thoughts raced through my mind that refused to let me enjoy it

So, while, pessimistically you can perceive it as "forced" and one would make you think that you shouldn't do things that are forced

I'd like to think that it was something I enjoy (true) that I needed to give more time because of how I handle my routine

And, I don't think that is an act of "force"

I'd like to think that it's actually an act of self-care

To do something that I enjoyed, did not want to do, but did anyway

And, in the end, I liked that I did it

I had fun playing a game for the whole day
