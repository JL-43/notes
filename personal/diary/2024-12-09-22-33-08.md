What makes you different, makes you strong

You are smart, JL. You aren't the smartest, sure, but that's not the point. You have it. And you must use it to protect people.

There are things you have done that are horrible. And you have hurt others. It took a long time to forgive ourselves for that. And it may be that others may never forgive us for it.

But, let's do good now. Let's focus on good now.

You are kind, JL. You aren't the kindest, sure, but that's not the point. You have it. And you must give it to yourself too.
