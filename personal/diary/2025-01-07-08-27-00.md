I keep having break downs internally

I was walking to work today and I had realized that i really have given up on myself

That all of the relationships I will ever have will be because someone needs something from me

And that I'd lovingly provide what they need, thinking that it is for the best

I woke up at 0330H today. I started to think of the people that have hurt me again. This time, not senpai, but Elaine instead

I felt so betrayed. That our friendship ultimately was impacted by something material--a monitor. And thinking about that, that my relationships with them grew because I provided material things and convenience

I needed Elaine on my move here. I needed a friend I could open up to

But I feel like everyone shut me out, that they spun their narrative and made me look like I was in it for something more--when always, always, I just wanted to help
