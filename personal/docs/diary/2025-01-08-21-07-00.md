You have no enemies, JL

Those people that have hurt you, it doesn't have to be now

But forgive

You have the strength to end the cycle of pain

To turn it into love

People may hurt you, don't act on vengeance

It's miniscule, and it's not going to be any time soon

But, the little efforts will save us all
