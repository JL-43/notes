Echoing a lot from Camus as I agree with his perspective the most, life has no meaning. Typically, that'll make someone feel hollow for hearing such

But, it's on the same coin that if nothing is defined, then you can do whatever the fuck you want

Another level of that is, since I can do whatever I want then I can just be a piece of shit asshole to everyone

Same coin, but instead of thinking you'd spend your time being an asshole, why not spend your time doing things that make you feel good instead?

You'd say, then I'll get high and do drugs

Same coin, feel free but doing that typically makes you feel bad after plus it's generally not good for your health

Why not join do regular, fun things? Like.. Get a hobby?

Thats where I am and how I made bank on my hobby

Life has no meaning but it has characteristics. Game theory suggests that the most efficient outcome is where everyone plays fair (be good to other people). Everything otherwise feeds mutually assured destruction
