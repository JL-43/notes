# Thoughts on AI and Interfaces

Will it learn eventually to interact effectively with the world?

Eyes, nose, skin, limbs

What if we give it it's own versions of

Given it's current understanding through the internet

What if we gave LLMs an interface to directly interact with reality

Imagine a long game of telephone

Or even if you aren't a programmer

And if you are a programmer, you know the more abstractions there are, the more can get lost in translation

A very "human" interface

It's a representation of reality through the lens of people. Placed on the medium of text, audio, video

Reality

If you think about it, what is the internet an abstraction of?

I want to propose something though

But, the internet is vast, and we haven't invested everything. We also have efforts in cleaning it up and tuning LLMs to point out "hey, that particular thing is a bit wrong"

The answers of LLMs will eventually turn to shit.

A major no-no in the world of machine learning. Where your training data and actual data are the same. Imagine LLMs spitting out a wrong answer, being posted on the internet, then using the internet to train the LLM

The more that LLMs are being used by the layman, the more that the training data is "polluted" . The internet itself.

But the core concept of machine learning is to have training data and actual data to verify if the predictions you make on the training data are accurate

Now, the internet has been where we drop EVERYTHING that we know about the world. It's our way to communicate internationally after all

The remaining problem of AI is its lack of an interface. For the past while, AI and LLMs specifically have been given the tools to interact with the internet. This has been mostly thru APIs as we don't typically have direct access to databases. This is why APIs rates fr various websites have increased. Because companies realized that APIs are no longer being used for third party apps but rather LLMs. Same thing happened to GPUs. They are no longer being used for games but rather to power the creation of LLMs. As GPUs are good at a specific type of compute made for games (vector math). It happens to be the same type of math used for LLMs
