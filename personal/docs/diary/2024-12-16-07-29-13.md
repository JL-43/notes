- I have died many times in my life
- And reincarnated just as many times
- In the times I thought that I'd not get out of something alive
- I always returned a different person
-
-
- All those times before
- I reincarnated with myself
- In a tomb with no one mourning except me
-
-
- It became pride
- To be able live and die all by myself
- But this life
- I can no longer proceed
- I cannot reincarnate
- For the pain of my self mourning
- Has become self pity
- 
- 
- A contradiction of pride and pity
- Another life I have to shed
- But I must die in peace
- No longer in war

--

- dying countlessly
- in a single lifetime
- experiencing the pain of rebirth
- just as many times
- every time
- a different person
- .
- .
- each time
- mourning in a tomb
- with only me
- and my countless bodies
- .
- .
- the loneliness
- becomes pride
- to exist in a reality
- with only me
- but ive stopped dying
- the pain of self mourning
- becomes self pity
- .
- .
- a life i must shed
- ego i must rid
- no longer in war
- but in peace
