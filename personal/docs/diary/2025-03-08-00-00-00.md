someone once told me that the world is my oyster

he was a very capitalistic man

but that does not mean he was not a good man

perhaps there was a little bit of protecting himself the most over others

but that does not mean he did not extend a hand whenever he could

but the world is not my oyster, whose pearl i am entitled to sell

the world is a garden, not just mine

and i must keep watering it and unweeding it

teaching my fellow gardeners 

how to make it more green
