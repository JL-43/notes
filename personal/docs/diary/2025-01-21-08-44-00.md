Yesterday I almost died

I almost got hit by a tram

I felt bad for the operator of the tram and the passengers

and I tried my best to gesture an apology, as I walked back to my home with shame

All I could really mutter was "oh shit" as I jumped quickly out of the way of the tram, it was already encroaching on my thigh

But I did not fear death

I did, though, think of how, if I had gotten hit by this tram, no one I know would know--out of all, for some reason, that haunts me the most

When I tell myself that, something as insignificant I in the context of the universe, should not really worry about these things
