If you see someone who is doing much better than you in your art

Let it not stop your pursuit of your art

It defiles how far you've come

It defiles how hard that individual has worked

"Put your head down and work"

Look at those who are better, and climb to stand on the same pedestal

Pull up those who want to see the same heights

Be wary, not everyone appreciates the view
