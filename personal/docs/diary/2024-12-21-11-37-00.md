# Pride

I'm prideful

I try to help everyone, love

But I can't ever see anyone ever getting to my level

I find the next one and learn from them

And by the time I'm better, I'm disappointed

I'm prideful, love

I try to use these gifts to save, love

But ain't no one saving me

Ain't no one praying for me

It's a cursed mind

Gifted as a blessing

Dragging me down, I can never be connected

Isolation

And irony

The gift I used to be with others

Is what outcasted me

I'm ashamed, love

I never wanted what was given to me

If it meant not being loved, love

But I got it now, love

No choice but to love myself, love

Pray for me, love, I'm unraveling

I'm starting to see what it feels like to be a God, love

Take that away from me

It's a cursed mind, love, turn it around

Hope it give me serenity
