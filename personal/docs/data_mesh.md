# Data Mesh Meeting 28012025

## SDPs and ADPs

SDPs should reflect, as much as possible, the source system

ADPs should focus on driving value for the end users

## Questions

How do we deal with the challenges?

  Common challenges are indicated as "comprehension", "resource limitation", "acceptance and resistance"

  How do we stop people from just sending excel documents to one another, create their own truths that they report on

How do we deal with overlapping SDPs sharing different facts?
