### Key Topics Covered

#### Data Extraction Options

Considering two approaches to extract data from Aveva PI:
1. Via SQL Server extract using Azure Data Factory (ADF).
2. Using the PI Web API (to avoid architectural and networking dependencies).

#### Data and Schema Requirements

- The user has documented the required data and schema in a table format.
- The main fact table of interest is EventFrameSnapshot.
- Several columns come from related tables (EventFrame and EventFrameAttribute), enriching the core facts. And making data pull on a time-based condition possible (see: EventFrame.Startime and EventFrame.EndTime)

#### Schema Differences

- The SQL-based approach has a defined schema, while the PI Web API returns JSON objects, leading to differences that must be reconciled or transformed.

#### Primary Columns/Fields Needed

- eventframe_attribute_id
- time
- value
- value_guid
- eventframe_id
- eventframe_name
- eventframe_start_time
- eventframe_end_time
- eventframe_can_be_acknowledged
- eventframe_acknowledged_on
- eventframe_acknowledged_by
- eventframe_attribute_name

Additional context for each column (data type, remarks, etc.) is provided.

#### Filtering & Enrichment

- EventFrameâ€™s start_time and end_time act as the filter window.
- Additional columns are included for programmatic enrichment (e.g., for foreign keys and enumerations).

### Development

#### Repository

We have created a private repository for the scripts:

[Github: PI SDP API](https://github.com/JL-43/pi_sdp_api)

#### Creating Tests

Following the Test-Driven Development methodology, we first created tests to define the expected output of our data extraction scripts.

We were able to define the schema and expected output by leveraging our existing [Functional Document](https://umicore365.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/TWS-002472/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4A3C1A46-63AF-4962-BC8E-AB85AB44CF73%7D&file=PI%20SDP.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) that describes the different tables we expect, and their schema definitions (See `Tables Schema Sheet`). Besides that, we also provided some mock data by querying in `PI SQL Commander Lite`
