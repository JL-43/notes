Yesterday, I studied my dbt course on udemy--I am around halfway through the course.

The things in the dbt course are mostly things that I have figured out already through experience; but I decided to still study it to build up on the foundation. Another good reason is to be able to have, perhaps, a better way to express what I know to my colleagues who look to me to teach them about it

The topics yesterday were mostly around Documentation

A few sparse points are:

- dbt can serve its own documentation via a small webserver
- it seems to be markdown focused
- you typically build up the content of the dbt documentation by filling up the `.yaml` file associated with each object
- each object will therefore have its own entry in the documentation, linking it also to relevant objects
- you can add context to an item by adding a "description" filed to it in the `.yaml` configuration.
- you are able to add more complex documentation by creating a `.markdown` document for a certain object, including images and such, then using a template header (with a syntax similar to jinja templating) to point what that document refers to
- you can access this by running a `dbt docs serve` command, if I recall correctly.
