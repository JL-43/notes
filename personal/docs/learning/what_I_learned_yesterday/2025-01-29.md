I havent watched any udemy videos in a while but I have been doing a lot of reading.

Yesterday, I learned a lot about data meshes and what makes them work.

My source mostly came out of one specific paper that I have been reading that is more of a meta study that converses with industry experts who have various experiences in the field

One of the key things that I learned, though, is that I am not out of place for feeling seemingly "lost" when it comes to talking about data mesh

As one of the biggest problems with it is making sure everyone is speaking the same language.

Everyone knows it at a high level, but on the detail level, it seems like every one seems to have their own interpretation of things.
