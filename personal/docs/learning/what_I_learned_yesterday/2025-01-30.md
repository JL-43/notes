Yesterday, I learned quite a bit reading Kimball's data warehousing toolkit

I learned about the shift in perspective of perceiving a data team as a "magazine team", in charge of interviewing people, gathering facts, and creating their magazine articles "reports".

That engineers are much like reporters, interviewers, and writers and manager are a lot like editor-in-chiefs

I also started to have a lot more confidence with creating data models

That there is a difference 3NF Models and Dimensional Models (and that both can be referred to as entity relationships)

3NF models focus on ease of data upsert while dimensional models focus on reportability and representability to the end user / reports
