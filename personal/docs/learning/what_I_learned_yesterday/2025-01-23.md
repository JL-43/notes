Yesterday I learned about clean code.

I learned about what makes names "good". And while it can be argued among different people, the guiding principle will always be:

"Names have to be meaningful"

And so, typically variables (data containers, pointers into a place in memory) should typically be represented by nouns or a short phrase with an adjective

while functions (logic that can be applied to the data held in data containers) should typically be represented by verbs or also a short phrase with an adjective

example:

`var adminUser = new User();` -- an example of a variable
`func authenticateUser(){...}` -- an example of a function
