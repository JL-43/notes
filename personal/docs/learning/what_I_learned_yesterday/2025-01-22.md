Yesterday, I learned about Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in the context of dbt.

The Udemy video that I followed described how to navigate to the graph of an object (using the same webserver for the docs, as it's hosted in the docs), and also select/deselect certain categories of related objects from the selected objects.

For example, we could be looking at a materialized view. I have the option to see only the upstream or the downstream objects, and even further, I could filter the objects that I do see (see only tests, transformations, other views, etc.).

I also learned about being able to do this through the dbt Power User Extension UI. It provides a different DAG UI, and also the capability to select and deselect them within the VSCode UI. It also provides the capability to run and build objects from the VSCode UI, indicating specific objects, and whether to also run/build upstream or downstream objects.
