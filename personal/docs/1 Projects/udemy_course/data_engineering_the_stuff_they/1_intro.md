# 1. Introduction to Real-World Data Engineering

## Video/Presentation Script

### Opening (1-2 minutes)
**Speaker (enthusiastic tone):**
"Welcome to *Data Engineering: The Stuff They Didn't Teach You*. In this first section, we'll discuss the real-world side of data engineering--beyond the basics. By now, you probably know how to read files, transform data, and load it into your cloud of choice. But let's be honest: once you start working on real-world projects, you'll discover there's a lot more to it. In this lesson, we're going to talk about why conceptual knowledge matters, what typical online tutorials gloss over, and then we'll dive into OLTP versus OLAP."

### 1.1 Beyond the Basics: Why Conceptual Knowledge Matters


### 1.2 Challenges That Tutorials Gloss Over (3-5 minutes)


### 1.3 Some DevOps concepts: Dev, Test, Prod


### 1.4 Understanding OLTP vs. OLAP (4-6 minutes)
**Speaker:**
"Before we jump into deeper topics, let's clarify a crucial distinction in the data world: **OLTP** (Online Transaction Processing) versus **OLAP** (Online Analytical Processing).

- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):**
  - Focuses on real-time transaction management.
  - Often used for day-to-day business operations, like e-commerce or banking systems.
  - Data is highly normalized for efficient inserts and updates.
  - Think of OLTP as the 'source of truth' for transactions.

- **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):**
  - Primarily used for reporting, analytics, and decision-making.
  - Often involves historical or aggregated data.
  - Typically uses denormalized schemas (like star or snowflake).
  - Think of OLAP as the 'analysis-friendly' store that helps you derive insights.

Why does this matter for data engineering? Because each type of system comes with its own requirements. The way you design pipelines, define data models, and optimize performance differs significantly between OLTP and OLAP. Throughout this course, we'll focus more on OLAP scenarios--like building data warehouses or data lakes for analytics--but you'll often be pulling data from OLTP systems. Understanding both paradigms helps you handle the data journey from ingestion to analytics."

### Conclusion
**Speaker:**
"That wraps up our introduction. In the next section, we'll explore *Data Modeling Fundamentals*, where we'll talk about star schemas, snowflake schemas, fact tables, and dimension tables. These concepts lay the groundwork for the more advanced topics to come. See you there!"

## Key Takeaways
- **Conceptual knowledge** is vital for long-term success in data engineering.
- **Real-world challenges** like data governance, performance tuning, and changing requirements are often glossed over in tutorials but are crucial in practice.
- **OLTP vs. OLAP** fundamentals set the stage for designing and implementing robust data pipelines, as their differing goals and architectures significantly influence how data should be handled.
