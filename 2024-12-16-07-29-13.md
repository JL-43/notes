- I have died many times in my life
- And reincarnated just as many times
- In the times I thought that I'd not get out of something alive
- I always returned a different person
-
-
- All those times before
- I reincarnated with myself
- In a tomb with no one mourning except me
-
-
- It became pride
- To be able live and die all by myself
- But this life
- I can no longer proceed
- I cannot reincarnate
- For the pain of my self mourning
- Has become self pity
- 
- 
- A contradiction of pride and pity
- Another life I have to shed
- But I must die in peace
- No longer in war
